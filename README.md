Using this app, a user can improve his or her vocabulary. Each time you visit the website you see a random word and if you don't know its meaning or meaning of any other word, you can search for the word. I used oxford-dictionary API to fetch the meaning of a word.
A user can also learn new words and later can test his knowledge by writing their meanings in the knowledge check section, and later can view his response and actual meaning of a word. The learning and knowledge check will be available to the user only for a day, next day new words will be there for the user to learn and test. So basically, in 24 hours a user can learn and test his knowledge.
